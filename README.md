# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the code that runs my personal portfolio website! You can take a look at the live version at [fradford.ca](https://fradford.ca)

In this iteration, I've used Next.js to build a mostly static website, with some dynamic elements using prisma to pull info from a database.
